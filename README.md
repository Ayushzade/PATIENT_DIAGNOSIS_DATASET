# PATIENT_DIAGNOSIS_DATASET
**Overview**


This project involves analyzing patient diagnosis data using Power BI to uncover insights into health risks, demographics, and lifestyle factors. The dashboard provides visualizations to explore various metrics such as heart attack incidence, stroke occurrence, weight distribution by occupation, and age group health status.

**Project Features**


*Heart Attack and Stroke Analysis: Visualizes the correlation between heart attacks and stroke occurrences.

*Health Risk Categorization: Classifies patients based on health risk levels (normal, moderate, high, critical).

*Occupation and Weight Distribution: Displays the distribution of weights across different occupation types.

*Demographic Analysis: Analyzes race, gender, and other factors in relation to weight status (overweight vs. not overweight).

*Age Group Health Trends: Examines health conditions across different age groups.

*Lifestyle and Health Factors: Incorporates habits, staff education levels, and other variables to assess their impact on health.




**Data**

*The dataset consists of patient history data with 28 attributes, including:


**Demographics:** Gender, race, age group.


**Health Indicators:** BMI, diabetes, heart attack, stroke, blood pressure, cholesterol.


**Lifestyle Factors:** Habits, occupation type.


**Other Variables:** Health risks, scnZone, staff education.




**Visualizations**



The Power BI dashboard contains several interactive charts and graphs:

*Bar charts showing counts of patients by health risk levels.

*Stacked bar charts visualizing stroke occurrences by heart attack status.

*Scatter plots and bar charts displaying weight distribution among different occupations.

*Demographic breakdowns by race, gender, and weight status.

*Analysis of lifestyle factors such as habits and their relationship to health outcomes.




**Getting Started**



*Clone the repository.

*Open the provided Power BI file (PatientDiagnosis.pbix) using Power BI Desktop.

*Explore the visualizations and interact with the data to gain insights.



**Requirements**



*Power BI Desktop

*Basic understanding of data analysis concepts
